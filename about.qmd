Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Arie!

Geological Engineering by background, Geoscientist/ Petrophysicists by title. Ten years of experience in the energy industry, care about data-driven decision making, and environmental importance in energy transition.

The person behind **[plotpetrophysics.xyz](https://plotpetrophysics.xyz/)**. A responsive web application to load a LAS file (a well-log data format), plotting, do some basic petrophysical analysis. 

My free time spent between cooking, reading, or explore the world of coding.
