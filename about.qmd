Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Arie!

I worked as a geoscientist / petrophysicists with ten years of experience in the energy industry. I care about implementing a data-driven workflow in every part of my works, and I believe environmental is as crucial as energy is, in today's and future's society. 
<!-- When not working, I am usually spending my time alone as introvert, or more often than not busy as a full-time Dad!  -->

I am the person behind [plotpetrophysics.xyz](https://plotpetrophysics.xyz/). A responsive web application to load a LAS file (a well-log data format), plotting, do some basic petrophysical analysis. Outside of my daily jobs, I enjoyed my time playing music (mostly guitars/drums), reading, learning some nice dataviz, or just taking care of my FPL team. This personal website is where put my thoughts, publications, and whatnot. 
<!-- I always into manga like One Piece and Black Clover, but recently found manhwa like The Legend of Northern Blade pretty awesome too!  -->

Thanks for dropping by!
