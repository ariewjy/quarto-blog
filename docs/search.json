I am interested in subsurface data and its intersection with the sustainability to ensure the inclusiveness of energy security for everyone.\nRecently, I made a web application to load a LAS file (a well-log data format), plotting, do some basic petrophysical analysis at plotpetrophysics.xyz.\nMy free time spent between cooking, reading, or exploring the world of coding.\nThanks for dropping by!"
